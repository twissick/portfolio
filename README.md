## Project 2: Recipe Database

I decided I wanted a better way to keep track of the food I ate. I was tired of looking for a new meal each week while wondering what I'd eaten, liked, or disliked. The result is what you see below: a database of all my recipes!

* Used PostgreSQL to model and create database containing all meals I've made in the last year
