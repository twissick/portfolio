# Data Analysis Portfolio

Hello, and welcome! My name is TJ, and I have a passion for all things data. As a burgeoning data analyst, I strive to apply data-driven thinking to all aspects of my life, both work and play. Below, you'll see a cross-section of some projects showcasing the growth of my talents as I continue to develop!

## [Project 1: Basic API Dashboard](https://github.com/twissick/portfolio/blob/main/index_dashboard.xlsm)

* Created "one-stop" API-based dashboard to read key market indexes
* Client-facing dashboard generated in Excel by request
* Data displayed as line graph, exportable records contained in each tab



## [Project 2: Recipe Database](https://github.com/twissick/portfolio/blob/main/recipe_db.sql)

I decided I wanted a better way to keep track of the food I ate. I was tired of looking for a new meal each week while wondering what I'd eaten, liked, or disliked. The result is what you see below: a database of all my recipes!

* Used PostgreSQL to model and create database containing all meals I've made in the last year
* Lists ingredients, side dishes, date last made, etc.
* Serves as centralized location for all meal prep, offering insights into diet and lifestyle



## [Project 3: IBM Analytics Capstone — EDA with Data Visualization](https://github.com/twissick/portfolio/blob/main/EDA%20with%20Data%20Visualization.ipynb)

* Used Python pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to generate graphs exploring SpaceX landings and launches
* Explored success rates of various orbit types, as well as trends over time

## [Project 4: Magic: The Gathering API Exploration](https://github.com/twissick/portfolio/blob/main/MTG_API_Investigation.ipynb)

Full disclosure — I really like Magic: The Gathering. I decided to build a small JupyterLab-based API that will let me query CSV files of cards to build or edit decks.

* Used Python to query Magic: The Gathering API service against cards in a CSV list
* Explored card prices as preliminary investigation in tracking trends
* Slowly expanding capability by reading out results in CSV or directly into PostgreSQL
* Integrating all decks into a Power BI dashboard that will let me track trends across several card collections
