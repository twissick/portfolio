# Data Analysis: Work and Play

Hello, and welcome! My name is TJ, and I have a passion for all things data. As a burgeoning data analyst, I strive to apply data-driven thinking to all aspects of my life, both work and play. Below, you'll see a cross-section of some projects showcasing my data analysis skills (and a few of my hobbies).

## [Project 1: Basic API Dashboard](https://github.com/twissick/portfolio/blob/main/index_dashboard.xlsm)

<kbd>![dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94941359/230518289-05d9f005-51d8-4f23-95e8-24edd095775a.png)</kbd>

* Created "one-stop" API-based dashboard to read key market indexes
* Each tab contains exportable records for report building



## [Project 2: Recipe Database](https://github.com/twissick/portfolio/blob/main/recipe_db.sql)

I decided I wanted a better way to keep track of the food I ate. I was tired of looking for a new meal each week while wondering what I'd eaten, liked, or disliked. The result is what you see below: a database of all my recipes!

* Used PostgreSQL to model and create database containing all meals I've made in the last year
* Lists ingredients, side dishes, date last made, etc.
* Serves as centralized location for all meal prep, offering insights into diet and lifestyle
* Soon to be integrated into Power BI dashboard to better interface with and visualize information



## [Project 3: IBM Analytics Capstone — EDA with Data Visualization](https://github.com/twissick/portfolio/blob/main/EDA%20with%20Data%20Visualization.ipynb)

* Used Python pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to generate graphs exploring SpaceX landings and launches
* Explored success rates of various orbit types, as well as trends over time

## [Project 4 (Pt. 1): Magic: The Gathering API Exploration](https://github.com/twissick/portfolio/blob/main/MTG_API_Investigation.ipynb)

Full disclosure — I really like Magic: The Gathering. I decided to build a Python API query that will let me read a dataframe into Power BI for visualization.

* Used Python to query Magic: The Gathering API service against cards in a CSV list
* Explored card prices as preliminary investigation in tracking trends
* Integrating all decks into a Power BI dashboard that will let me track trends across several card collections

## [Project 4 (Pt. 2): Magic: The Gathering Dashboard](https://github.com/twissick/portfolio/blob/main/mtg_dashboard.pbix)

As an extension of my initial Python exploration of MTG datasets, I created a Power BI dashboard that gives me visualized insights into my own deck building.

* Visualized wording trends in card text using word cloud
* Tracking card prices based on distinct printings used in different decks
* Check overall deck composition based on theme
* I may eventually integrate a way to track price history by determining price of card when purchased vs. current price

## [Project 5: Translation Website](https://github.com/twissick/portfolio/blob/main/Website/homepage.html)

I hold a Master's Degree in Translation Studies. One key part of this industry is marketing yourself, and in seeking to do so, I built my own website.

<kbd>![website_cap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94941359/231890450-8f77bf81-de88-4b90-a1e0-683b3c02eae3.png)</kbd>

* Small portfolio of translation projects included
* Website also includes contact forms and links to popular social media
* Dynamic buttons and objects give website a robust and professional feel
